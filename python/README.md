# AReS ‚Äì Anesthesia Response Simulator

**AReS** (Anesthesia Response Simulator) is an open-source tool designed to simulate patient responses under anesthesia. 

You can use AReS as a standalone Python package for simulations or explore and modify it locally.

---

## üì¶ Option 1: Install AReS as a Python Package

Use this option if you want to **integrate AReS in your own Python projects** without modifying the source code.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* Git

### Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ManuMerlo/AReS-Anesthesia-Response-Simulator.git@main#subdirectory=python
```

### Usage

Import the package in your Python scripts and call its functions as needed.
Example notebooks demonstrating usage are available in the `python/notebooks/` folder of this repository.

---
## üîß Option 2: Local Development Setup

Use this option to **run notebooks and explore or modify the source code** in a local environment.

### Prerequisites

* [Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* Git

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal-Based Workflow

Use this workflow if you prefer working in a terminal or command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManuMerlo/AReS-Anesthesia-Response-Simulator.git
cd AReS-Anesthesia-Response-Simulator/python
```

### 2. Create the Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 3. Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate AReS
```
Open and run notebooks located in the `notebooks/` folder (note: some notebooks are outside the `python` folder).

---

## üñ•Ô∏è IDE-Based Workflow

If you prefer to work inside an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you can run everything there ‚Äî notebooks and code ‚Äî by configuring your IDE to use the Conda environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository and Open the Project

1. On the **Welcome screen**, select **Clone Repository**
2. Paste the repo URL: `https://github.com/ManuMerlo/AReS-Anesthesia-Response-Simulator.git`
3. Choose your destination folder and clone
4. Open the **root folder**:
   `AReS-Anesthesia-Response-Simulator`

---

### 2. Create the Conda Environment

* Open the terminal inside your IDE or a system terminal.

* Navigate into the `python` folder (where `environment.yml` is located):

  ```bash
  cd python
  ```

* Create the Conda environment:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

* Activate the environment:

  ```bash
  conda activate AReS
  ```

* Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
* Select `Python: Select Interpreter`
* Choose the Conda environment named `AReS`
* You can now run notebooks and scripts directly from the root folder or any subfolder
