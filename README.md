# AReS - Anesthesia Response Simulator

This repository contains the source code for AReS (Anesthesia Response Simulator), a comprehensive anesthesia patient simulator designed to mimic the response of a patient undergoing total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with four commonly used drugs: propofol, remifentanil, norepinephrine, and rocuronium. The simulator is available in both Python and MATLAB versions.
The methods for developing AReS and several analysis to examine its performance are provided in the following reference:

## Features

* **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Modeling**: AReS utilizes population-based and subject-specific PK/PD models to predict drug effects on various physiological parameters.
* **Target-Controlled Infusion (TCI)**: The simulator incorporates a TCI module to control drug concentrations at the target site (plasma or effect-site).
* **Surgical Stimuli**: AReS can simulate various surgical stimuli with varying dynamics and durations, allowing for the investigation of the patient's response to surgical stress.
* **Fluid Loss**: The simulator can also model the effect of fluid loss on the patient's physiological response.
* **Output Variables**: AReS provides predictions for a range of vital physiological parameters, including:
    * Depth of hypnosis (NeuroWave index and Bispectral Index)
    * Cardiac output
    * Mean arterial pressure
    * Heart rate
    * Stroke volume
    * Neuromuscular blockade

## Repository Structure

* **Python**: Source code for the Python version of AReS, implemented as a Python package.
* **Matlab**: Source code for the MATLAB version of AReS.
